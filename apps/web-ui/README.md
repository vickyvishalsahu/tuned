# @tuned/web-ui

The frontend for Tuned. Built with Next.js 15 App Router.

Handles Spotify OAuth, the player UI, and playback via the Spotify Web Playback SDK. Talks to `@tuned/backend` for track selection and session state.

> See the [root README](../../README.md) for full setup, commands, and the explanation of why we use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`.

## Running

```bash
# From the monorepo root (recommended)
pnpm dev                               # starts both apps
pnpm dev --filter=@tuned/web-ui        # starts only this app

# From this directory
pnpm dev
```

Runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` — **not** `localhost:3000`. See the root README for why.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | From [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | From Spotify Developer Dashboard |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` — do not change this locally |

## Spotify OAuth quirk

The dev server binds to `127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`) because Spotify's OAuth redirect URI must exactly match what's registered in the dashboard, and Spotify won't accept `localhost` as a redirect host. The registered URI is:

```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/spotify/callback
```

The `-H 127.0.0.1` flag in the `dev` script and the redirect in `src/middleware.ts` enforce this.

## Auth flow

```
User clicks "Sign in with Spotify"
  → GET /api/auth/spotify          (sets state cookie, redirects to Spotify)
  → Spotify login
  → GET /api/auth/spotify/callback (exchanges code, sets access/refresh token cookies)
  → Redirect to /tuned
```

Tokens are stored in cookies (`spotify_access_token`, `spotify_refresh_token`). The middleware checks for `spotify_access_token` to protect `/tuned`.
